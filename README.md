# Predicting Customer Default Behavior
An important task for banking institutions is to identify potential default behaviors among their customers to mitigate financial risks. This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify patterns of default behavior using historical customer data.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains historical information of customers (ID) whose credit card applications were approved. Each record includes whether the customer defaulted (default = 1) or not (default = 0). The potential input variables for predicting default behavior are:

- Age: Age of the customer.
- Income: Annual income of the customer.
- Exp Inc: Proportion of monthly credit card expenditure to annual income.
- Avgexp: Monthly credit card expenditure.
- Ownrent: Ownership status of a residence (0 for rent, 1 for ownership).
- Selfempl: Employment status (0 for employed, 1 for self-employed).
- Depndt: Number of dependents.
- Inc per: Income divided by the number of dependents.
- Cur add: Duration of residence in the current address (in months).
- Major: Number of credit cards held by the customer.
- Active: Number of active credit accounts.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify customers into default or non-default categories based on their demographic and financial characteristics.
